-- | This module provides access to a distributed FIFO queue which can hand out
-- work concurrently with the minimal possible duplication of work (on job
-- failure only).
--
-- For simplicity, we do not store any information on the job other than a JobID
-- UUID, selected by the user on push with 'queue'. This is expected to
-- reference the work stored elsewhere that a worker will subsequently fetch.
--
-- TODO: Track job completion times and worker IDs
